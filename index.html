The autobiographical tale, filled with people Joel saw shuffle in and out of a Los Angeles bar during his time as a lounge singer, stands as one of the all-time best supporting-character studies.</p>
                    <p>Rolling Stone mused that Piano Man "represents a new seriousness and flexibility" for Joel, comparing it to the stylings of Elton John.  Reviewing the album, Billboard stated that it shows that Joel has a "fine shot at establishing himself as consistent quality AM artist with large scale songs and dynamic performing range.</p>
